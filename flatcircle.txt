If it's all relative. We should probably remind ourselves every know and then. We live distracted from the things that
matter. Time stops for no one, it's hard to be grateful for something you don't even know is there. There is infinite dread in the our inability to truly stop. Productivity eats our mental, shreds our confidence and destroys direction. 

The sheer idea of effective use of time is one of lifes greatest illusions. There is no one true idea of time well spent. Work towards something that is meaningful to you, impactful to your sense of self. That is in it's most abstract form what is worth it to you.
